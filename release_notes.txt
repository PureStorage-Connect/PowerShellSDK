The Pure Storage PowerShell SDK provides integration with the Purity Operating Environment and FlashArray. It provides functionalities of Purity's REST API as PowerShell cmdlets.

RELEASE COMPATIBILITY

This release requires PowerShell 3.0 or higher.
This release requires .NET 4.5.
This release is compatible with Purity FlashArrays that support Pure Storage REST API 1.0 to 1.13 inclusive.
This release requires a 64-bit operating system. 

INSTALLATION AND UNINSTALLATION

To install the PowerShell SDK, extract and run PurePowerShellSDKInstaller.msi, and follow the instructions. Administrator privilege is required to install. To verify the installation, run "Get-Command -Module PureStoragePowerShellSDK" in a new PowerShell prompt. The newly installed cmdlets should be listed. The PowerShell SDK can be uninstalled from "Programs and Features" of the Control Panel.

The PowerShell SDK can also be installed using the PowerShell Gallery. See https://www.powershellgallery.com/ for details on how to discover resources on the PowerShell Gallery.
